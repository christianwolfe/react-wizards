# Wizard Form!

- create a form for editing 3 attributes
    - name
    - occupation
    - house
- on form submit, save that to an array ... somewhere
    - confirm the new wizard is in the array by:
        - consoloe.log()
        - maybe list them out
        - or use inspector


## Steps
- [ ] Create a WizardForm.jsx
